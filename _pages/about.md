I am currently working towards a PhD in computer science at [Brunel University London](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/).

My thesis focuses on how deep learning-based virtual fitting rooms can support online businesses by enabling customers to interact with clothing products. I have been utilising and developing computer vision and generative AI techniques to minimise the gap between virtual interaction with clothing and real-life experiences.

I am passionate about using my skills to help all types of businesses leverage generative AI to support business functions and make the best use of it.
